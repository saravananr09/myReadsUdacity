MyReads Project:::
---------------
MyReads React project for FEND nanodegree. Udacity provided the static code of the CSS and HTML markup, but without any of the React code. The goal of this project was to add interactivity to the app by refactoring the static code in this template using React.

To get started:::
---------------
    1.Download the project folder. The node-modules folder was removed from this submission to save space.
    2.Navigate to the project folder reactnd-project-myreads-starter
    3.Install all project dependencies with npm install
    4.This project uses react-router-dom for routing. Install with npm install --save react-router-dom
    5.Start the development server with npm start
    6.Note that the development build is not optimized. To create a production build, use npm run build

Important:
---------
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in SEARCH_TERMS.md. That list of terms are the only terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

How to Use:
----------
Move books from shelf to shelf by selecting a new shelf from the drop-down. Use the add button to add new books to the shelves on the main page. Filter books but typing in the search box. You can filter by author or title.
